Step 0: ensure the sql schemas in /src/sql are run

Step 1: execute `make`
Result: app opens and runs

Step 2: login as 
	username='teq01@teq.ca'
	password='password' 
	(no '')
Result: user is taken to administrative tab UI for high level teq employees

Step 3: go to the run preset query tab and ensure "add a preset query" is pressed
Result: shows the user a textbox for query and one for description, as well as the options to edit and remove a preset, and an add preset button at the bottom.

Step 4: type in "SELECT * FROM Presets;" and let description be "Return the Presets table", and then go to the edit preset query. Select "SELECT * FROM Presets;; Return the Presets table" if it is not already selected.
Result: The query "SELECT * FROM Presets;" exists in the query box and "Return the Presets table" exists in the description box.

If this final result is true then the acceptance test has succeeded.
